Thessaloniki.Net MeetUp is a group for anyone interested in .NET programming and programming in general.
Focused on but not limited to people who are currently or were in the past employed as developers, so we can discuss things about our profession.
All skills levels are welcome. Students too, of course.
We hope this will become a nice party and organise lots of events.


Our Goals and Philosophy:

We are a group of people involved in programming - as professionals or as students or even amateurs, and we are interested in .NET technologies (desktop, web, cloud, etc.), all relevant programming languages ​​(c #, vb.net, f# etc.) and all related tools (Visual Studio, Xamarin etc.). 
Our goal is to better understand the wide range of .NET technologies through socialization and pleasant company. 
The aim for all of us is to learn, not only through presentations or workshops but also through small or larger projects. 
The team members are willing to share their experience and knowledge and help each other on a team or individual level. 
The Thessaloniki .Net meetup is extroverted and tries to establish connections with other groups of developers operating in our area (whether related with .Net or not) in order to promote technological and programming culture in our city, for the greater benefit. 
We are all volunteers and not a representative or official body of Microsoft or any other company. 
The people involved respect the rules of good behavior and teamwork.
